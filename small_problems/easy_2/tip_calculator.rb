# prompt for the bill amount and the tip rate
# display the tip and the total (tip included)

# => What is the bill? 200
# => What is the tip percentage? 15

# => The tip is $30.0
# => The total is $230.0

# ask for the bill and save it in a bill(pre tip) variable
# ask for a tip percentage and save it in a tip percent variable
# calculate the tip and display it
