# build a program that displays when the user will retire and how many years to go

# => What is your age? 30
# => At what age would you like to retire? 70

# => It's 2016. You will retire in 2056.
# => You have only 40 years of work to go!

# ask the user for their age and save that into a variable
# ask the user what age they want to retire and save that into variable
# calculate years to retirement by subtracting retirement age from current age
# add those years to current year (2018)
